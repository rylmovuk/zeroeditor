# zeroeditor
An user-friendly IDE thought for people who have never got in contact with code


## Building (Node and npm required)
Clone with git, open a terminal and type:
`npm install`


Then you could use:
- `npm run build` - production build, will create zeroeditor.js and styles.css on /dist folder
- `npm run dev`   - start server on localhost:8080, just open your browser and edit source files (auto-update is enabled)
